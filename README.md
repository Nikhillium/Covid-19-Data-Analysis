🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

    A data science project exploring the global impact and spread of COVID-19 using real-world datasets. This project focuses on uncovering trends, visualizing key metrics, and building predictive models to understand the progression of the pandemic.

📌 Project Goals

    ~ Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data
    ~ Create clear, insightful visualizations of cases, deaths, and recoveries
    ~ Analyze regional trends and government intervention impacts
    ~ Apply predictive modeling techniques to forecast future trends

📊 Key Components

    📂 Data Preprocessing
        Cleaned and prepared global COVID-19 data for analysis

    📈 Visual Analysis
        Created charts and graphs for infection trends, death rates, and recovery patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn

    📉 Statistical Insights
        Explored correlations and distributions to detect regional patterns

    🔮 Forecasting Models
        Used time series analysis and regression to predict future case trends
